# Animal Prosthetics

Ever wanted to put a peg leg on a pet and were dissapointed you couldn't? Animal Prosthetics adds prosthetics to animals.

Animal Prosthetics aims to be as vanilla as possible, adding existing (human) prosthetics to animals. For animals specific body parts — such as paws, beaks or hooves — new prosthetics are added that act similar to existing prosthetics.

Modded prosthetics are **not supported**, though modded animals are (if they extend from `AnimalThingBase`).
